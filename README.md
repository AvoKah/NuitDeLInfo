This is a android application we made for the IBM challenge of the "Nuit de l'info".
We were not able to integrate it to bluemix, because we could not put on the IBM cloud.
Moreover we did not know anything concerning web/android programming that's why we had to make a lot of 
researches before. Nonetheless, it was a really interesting experience for all of us because we learnt
a lot. We made a simple application related to the main subject, so we implemented a application
which would make people aware of all the health problems in the world and that their donations could
improve researches concerning people safety.
Concerning the android application we used some java and xml that we never used before, and the IDE
eclipse.
